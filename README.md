I created an AR app for my final year essay and if you would like to try it out, feel free!

## Steps to use:

1. Download the following Unity app on an Android phone:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/oi93nzdt5egfptm/CensorshipAR.apk?dl=0

2. Print out the following image on an A4 sheet of paper:
https://Hannah02.github.io/IXD502/censorship2.png
<sub><sup>(you could display the image at 100% size on a screen also, I have just found it easier and more reliable to physically print out the target image)</sup></sub>

3. Open the app and point it at the paper. A bit.ly link for the website and a password to grant access to the site will be revealed.

4. Use a web browser to follow the link and enter the password to access the essay!

This app was created using Unity and Vuforia.
